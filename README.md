# langdida-ui

langdida-ui is a front-end project designed to be used with langdida-server. langdida is a "personal use" language learning tool that I created based on my reference to lingQ. (lingQ is a great language learning platform, but some of its designs did not completely meet my needs, so I decided to create my own language learning tool.)

The UI is designed using flutter and is expected to support the following platforms:

1. Web page
2. Android app
3. Windows app

The UI is expected to include three main pages:

1. Article reading
2. Vocabulary review
3. Learning progress.
